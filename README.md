# ZWUtils-CPP
This utility library provides basic run-time services, such as log management, configuration loading and saving, thread synchronization primitive and objects, memory debugging support, etc. to C++ applications.

It is the rewrite of [ZWUtils-VCPP](https://github.com/Adam5Wu/ZWUtils-VCPP), which was mainly targeting Visual C++. Instead, this library aims at cross-platform compatibility. In addition, it fully embraces C++ RAII, which brings BIG performance improvement compared with using __finally clause, something I discovered after the predecessor library is mostly completed. I also try to employ C++11 features where they could improve performance/code readability.
